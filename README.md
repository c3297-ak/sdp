# Limitations

##1. With respect to stakeholdersâ€™ needs and requirements
Currently our application allows users to autonomously register for an account, which does not comply with the security requirement of AB Credit. In the future, the registration system will be linked to AB Credit user database to verify credentials of the registering user.
Other than that, The system has implemented all the functionalities needed to meet the needs, requirements and constraints proposed by the stakeholders.

##2. With respect to the design ideas and additional features proposed by the project team
The system has not been able to deal with cases where the system or database fails, such as it has not implemented a good scheme for system recovery and data loss prevention. This can be resolved by using a different robust server than the development server provided by Django such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Also, the system does not take into account a browser's auto expiring cookie policy. The user has to login into the system again to continue using it. Moreover, the user has to logout off the system to exit the login session.
